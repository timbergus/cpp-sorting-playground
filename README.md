# C++ Sorting Playground

Simple project to lear C++ and sorting algorithms.

The cool thing is I'm using [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) to plot the result ðŸ™‚

## Run the Project

There is a makefile with a few instructions to build and run the project.

```bash
make clean

make init

make project

make start
```

## Dependencies

This projects depends on [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) and [fmt](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html).

If you are in Mac, you can install them using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you are in Windows or Linux try to find someone that knows more than me about that platforms ðŸ˜…

You can configure intellisense adding them into the `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` configuration file, under `includePath`.

They usually live inside `/opt/homebrew/Cellar`.
